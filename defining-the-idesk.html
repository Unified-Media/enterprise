			<a name="casestudy"><h3><b>Case study</b></h3></a>
				<p>In working on this project, I thought it would be helpufl to reach out to industry experts to learn best practices for digital design desks in the indjustry. The following is a conversation with <a href="http://amycavenaile.com">Amy Cavenaile</a>, a designer with the Emerging News Prodcuts team at the Washington Post.</p>

				<p><strong>If you had to write a few-sentence summary of the Emerging News Products team, perhaps in response to "so, what do you do here?", what would it be?</strong></p>
				<p>The Emerging News Products team is in the business of re-packaging and re-imagining existing WP content for different digital platforms.
				As a designer/visual editor, it’s my job to know what’s best for each platform in terms of design and display copy (headlines, decks, subheads, etc.).
				Our platforms currently include Rainbow (The Post’s national news app), Snapchat Discover, Facebook instant articles and editions, Apple News and soon it will include The Lily, which I’ll explain later.</p>
				 
				<p><b>How many people are part of Rainbow? What roles do you think are essential for a team like this to function?</b></p>
				 
				<p>It’s a team of about 20, but this year we expect to grow substantially — adding (possibly) 15 people.
				We’re made up of editors, designers and producers. For a small operation, I think you could get away with one editor (someone with a knack for visuals and display copy), possibly two if you want one person to oversee content and the other to oversee design. Then you’ll need a handful of producers and a handful of designers.</p>
				 
				<p><b>What does the workflow look like? How do stories get from the people who write them to the people who read them?</b></p>

				<p>I’ll take you through both Rainbow and Snapchat, because I think they’ll both be helpful to you.
				The content is written by a reporter and posted to WP.com by that reporter’s editor.</p>

				<p><b>RAINBOW:</b></p>
				<p>Rainbow has a CMS that’s been built custom for us by our team of engineers. That system automatically imports stories from WP.com for us.</p>
				<p>At this point, a producer takes a look at the story and edits it for Rainbow. He or she will change the headline, making it more concise and conversational. Local references (since we have a national audience) will be edited out, subheads may be added, photos/graphics may be added.</p>
				<p>The story is then passed to a designer. The designer takes the new headline written by the producer and creates a “bright” (our name for a story topper). I’m sure you’ve seen these before, but if you need examples, I have a few on my website. 
				That bright is uploaded to our CMS and then published to the app.</p>

				<p><b>SNAPCHAT:</b></p>
				<p>Snapchat has their own CMS for publishers like WaPo, but it’s VERY basic and we can only import stories by copy/pasting.</p>
				<p>So a producer will copy/paste and decide the best way to tell the specific story for Snapchat. Sometimes, that means boiling a 500 to 1000 word story down to a headline and two bullet points. Other times, it means cutting several graphs and adding subheads to help easily distracted readers get through the story, etc etc.
				The content (with it’s new structure and headline) is then passed along to a designer who will create the snaps, send to an animator and then upload to the Snapchat CMS.</p>
				 
				<p><b>Do you use a different design philosophy/strategy for different platforms? For example, do you think, "This is for the app, so it should be ____ vs Snapchat which should be ____"?</b></p>

				<p>Yes yes yes. Rainbow operates with this mantra in mind: Platform agnostic is lazy.
				That goes for design as well as content!</p>
				<p>I think it’s so important to be all about your audience. And the audience for each platform is different. And the platforms themselves are different. You want content to be the most optimized for your platform AND audience.</p>
				<p>For example, headlines that run in Rainbow are almost always different from the headlines we use for Snapchat. Design may be similar, but for Rainbow we’re working with a square-shaped bright and Snapchat is a vertical rectangle that can accommodate animation, so of course we may use the same design assets, but we’re optimizing for each platform/audience.</p>
				<p>Another example for you: Steve Bannon spoke about how he and the Trump administration want to 'deconstruct' the way the U.S. government functions. For our Snapchat audience (18 to 24 year olds), my design was very conceptual. I literally put Steve Bannon in a hard hat with wrecking balls swinging behind him. (You can see it here.) But for Rainbow (35 to 50 year olds), we used a news photo of Bannon with a simple headline treatment.</p>
				 

				<p><b>How does your team explore/expand to new platforms?</b></p>
				 
				 <p>In the realm of exploration, it’s all about the audience. Think about these key questions:</p>
				 <ul>
				 <li>Do you have a key demographic missing from your current audience?</li>
				 <li>Where do those people go to get their news content or ANY content for that matter?</li>
				 <li>And how can you re-imagine your existing content for that platform in order to target that audience?</li>
				 </ul>

				<p>I mentioned The Lily earlier. We’re launching it this spring. It’s an experimental, visually-driven product that will reimagine WP content for millennial women. What does that actually mean?</p>
				 
				<p>It’s basically what we’ve been doing all along with Post content, but now, for this key demographic (millennial women) we’re going to experiment by allowing all our content to live on social media under a sub-brand a.k.a. The Lily. We’ll house stories on Medium, Facebook and Instagram. And in order to do that, we’ll most definitely have to re-imagine the traditional story form that makes up most of The Post’< content. And design is a key part of that process.</p>


				<p><b>Does your team interact with print at all? Do you talk/plan with print page designers?</b></p>

				<p>The honest answer is “rarely.” We definitely share assets (photos/graphics/illustrations, etc.).
				I will say that we’ve had some success in designing things for digital, like social share images, that have later wound up being the centerpiece art on a print section cover.</p>


				<p><b>Do you think this is the future of digital design? I was talking to Javier Zarracina from Vox and he was saying it's becoming now more important to engage readers with good design on social because they may never make it to your site — what do you think of this?</b></p>

				<p>Absolutely. It’s literally the reason I took this job. Sure, it was an offer from The Washington Post, but I was so thrilled with the Rainbow product and team. I knew instantly they had something special.</p>

				<p>Beyond Rainbow, there’s social media, like you mentioned. But really it’s the same idea. Platform agnostic is lazy. That’s why Rainbow became a thing in the first place. People are consuming content differently and it’s important for us, as journalists, to go find our audiences, because like Javier said, they’re not necessarily finding us. Good, smart design which makes up a large portion of successful alternative storytelling on social is absolutely essential.</p>

			<a name="jobdescription"><h3><b>The Creative Director</b></h3></a>
			<p>I created this job description for the iDesk Creative Director. It served as the basis for hiring for the 2017-18 director.</p>

			<h4>iDesk Creative Director</h4>

			<p>The creative director oversees Unified Media’s iDesk, the central command center for digital products. They are responsible for staffing and managing the print Daily News design studio, overseeing the rest of the iDesk team and maintaining a consistent design and experience across Ball State Daily platforms.</p>

			<p><b>Specifically, this includes:</b></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Managing articles on ballstatedaily.com to ensure a diverse selection of content appears on the homepage (as well as changing the top feature image)</li>
			<li>Assisting Unified Media (editorial and advertising) staff in using the Gryphon CMS</li>
			<li>Working with the Advertising and Creative Suite to (1) ensure advertising appears as it should across digital platforms, (2) manage and produce content for the Ball State Daily social media and (3) developing new digital advertising platforms</li>
			<li>Contacting SNWorks, the website vendor, for technical support or design tweaks</li>
			<li>Providing guidance to the print design staff, especially when planning special sections or designs</li>
			<li>Creating unique digital pages for longform stories or projects</li>
			<li>Overseeing and leading design of social media, including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram Stories</li>
			<li>Developing new strategies for engagement and content in the digital space, specifically through developing and welcoming new publications and content into the Unified Media ecosystem</li>
			</ul>

			<p><b>Ideal candidates must be team players, problem solvers, exceptional communicators and have:</b></p>
			<ul>
			<li>A strong background in design</li>
			<li>Familiarity with HTML, CSS and JavaScript OR comparable experience with WordPress, Joomla, CCI, NewsEdit Pro or another content management system</li>
			<li>An interest and desire in telling stories digitally</li>
			<li>Knowledge of existing and emerging social media platforms</li>
			<li>The ability to complete projects on deadline and manage others to do so</li>
			<li>Impeccable communication skills and experience in a leadership role</li>
			<li>Thorough knowledge of AP style and editing</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Unified Media is a fast-moving media organization and this position is seen as near (if not) the top of student leadership roles. The iDesk Creative Director must be comfortable managing their own staff, working with other student leaders and being a point of contact for faculty leadership and the Department of Journalism.</p>

			<a name="gryphon"><h3><b>Improving Gryphon</b></h3></a>
			<h4><b>Embedded video</b></h4>
			<p>When embedding videos on the site, you want to run them through http://embedresponsively.com so that the frame resizes to accommodate both mobile and desktop viewers. This isn’t something that Gryphon does on its own.</p>

			<h4><b>Eliminating the dropcap</b></h4>
			<p>Create a SafeEmbed with the first paragraph wrapped in &lsaquo;p&rsaquo; tags. This will override the automatic dropcap which sometimes looks a little funny.</p>

			<h4><b>Tags</b></h4>
			<p><b>Homepage</b><br>
			Full width feature article tagged: ‘homepage-feature’
			Homepage articles stream: ‘top-stories’</p>

			<h4><b>Ads</b></h4>
			<p>Footer ad - pulls highest weighted/most recent image tagged: ‘footer-ad’</p>

			<h4><b>Sidebar</b></h4>
			<p>“In The News”: Pulls page with slug ‘in-the-news’. Title in black box comes from page title in Gryphon. Content in page should entered as follows:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Copy/paste headline in on new line.</li>
			<li>Highlight headline and use the insert link button.</li>
			<li>Copy URL from news story in browser, and paste into insert link dialog box - can use checkbox for opening in new tab if desired.</li>
			<li>Put a space after the link, then type the source for the story.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p><b>Sections</b></p>
			<p>Section tags are set in Gryphon on the Section’s page, in the “Tag” box.
			Daily News stories need “daily-news” tag to appear on DN section page
			If you are on /section/daily-news/ then the DN logo would appear.</p>

			<h4><b>Articles</b></h4>
			<ul>
			<li>Meta value “full width image”: Check this box to have image display full width of screen.</li>
			<li>Top Logo: looks for a Tag of the group that wrote the article</li>
			<li>‘daily-news’:  Daily News Logo</li>
			<li>‘sports-link’ : Sports Link Logo</li>
			<li>‘ball-bearings’  : Ball Bearings Logo</li>
			<li>‘byte’ : Byte Logo</li>
			<li>‘newslink’ : Newslink Logo</li>
			<li>‘wcrd’ : WCRD Logos</li>
			</ul>

			<h4><b>Weighting</b></h4>
			<p>Stories on homepage are organized by weight then creation date. </p>
			<p>The homepage-feature also depends on weight. For example, NewsLink’s live banner is always weighted five but published/unpublished so it always appears at the top of the page.</p>


			<h4><b>Creating shortlinks</b></h4>
			<p>It’s really handy to make shortlinks (ballstatedaily.com/what-you-want) to direct readers to special content. You can also make a Ball State Daily link to an outside (or enterprise!) page.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Go to Settings>URL Redirects</li>
			<li>Click “+ New Redirect”</li>
			<li>The “In Path” is what you want to appear after ballstatedaily.com</li>
			<li>The “Out Path” is where you want the reader to end up</li>
			<li>The “Test Redirect” button is worthless</li>
			</ul>
			<p><i>Note: Give it at least five minutes to work.</i>

			<h4><b>How to guess if an article is at risk of freezing</b></h4>
			<p>The basic structure of the Gryphon articles (when viewed with the ‘Code Editor’) is
			&lsaquo;p&rsaquo;Paragraph of the story&lsaquo;/p&rsaquo;
			It doesn’t use any kind of inline styling or if/then statements. If you see anything starting with quotes, dots or &lsaquo;style&rsaquo;, clear it out or click the "Clean HTML" button. 
			</p>

			<p>If an article freezes (no matter how many times you try to check it out it just keeps spinning), you’ll have to contact SNWorks.</p>

			<h4><b>Stencils</b></h4>
			<p>Bradley Jones created something he called “stencils” which take a lot of the legwork out of writing code. As of April 2017, we have stencils that generate a quiz, quad talk, comparison slider, inline photo, pull quote, Google chart, responsive embed, marge/sidebar, and mug</p>

			<hr style="margin:30px">

			<a name="advertising"><h3><b>Working with advertising</b></h3></a>
			<p>A key function of the iDesk is working with students in the advertising, public relations and sales departments. One of the biggest features of this is the creation of sponsored content, outlined below:</p>

			<ul>
			<li>Insert the article into Gryphon as usual. The advertising staff is generally pretty good at this. They sometimes forget to set images to “Publish” or set an actual publish time.</li>
			<li>Apply kicker ‘sponsored’ which will put a black kicker on it.</li>
			<li>Find a previous sponsored article and put the black ‘Sponsored’ box onto it (just a rectangular div with black background that says ‘SPONSORED’)</li>
			<li>Add weight 1 so it stays above regularly published content</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The advertising staff was also very interested in selling the enterprise pages, but there was no system in place for this to happen previously. My recommendation is for them to sell strip ads (similar to the New York Times) </p>

			<p><b>Major projects the iDesk works with advertising on:</b></p>

			<p><i>Best of Ball State</i></p>
			<p>You will need to create a standalone page (Gryphon Pages tab) that hosts their survey. It can be embedded but does a weird size — be sure to run it through embedresponsively.
			Results they will most likely publish as sponsored content.</p>

			<p><i>Promotions</i></p>
			<p>For the dining promotion, we built a page that hosted their entry form. 
			We used a Gleam embeddable to make the dining contest work. It logged IP address so people could only enter once per day.
			There’s still not a great way to link to pages, so I would link to the contest in the “In the News” section</p>

			<p><i>Graduation wishes/Special sections</i></p>
			<p>Make a separate page and embed the Issuu document. You could also create an article and run it as sponsored content so it can be tagged to the feed.</p>

			<a name="curriculum"><h3><b>Suggestions for curriculum</b></h3>
			<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.bsd/35627_journalistsdof.png" style="float:left; width:350px; margin-right: 20px">
			<p>Three years of observation in the Ball State journalism curriculum and I’ve boiled it down to this.</p>

			<p>So what does that mean for student media and the role it plays with curriculum?</p>
			<ul>
			<li>We need to promote unlimited opportunity</li>
			<li>We have to be unafraid to explore new platforms</li>
			<li>We need to push people to actually do this stuff</li>
			</ul>

			<p><b>Promoting unlimited opportunity</b></p>
			<p>Student media has and always will adapt much faster than the curriculum ever could. Adam Baumgartner was coding at the iDesk before J106 even existed.
			That means we need to heave leadership in student media that promotes new types of student work and we need faculty in classes showcasing work that isn’t a 600-word text story.
			Yes — a lot of the classes are writing or video based. These are good skills and people in “traditional” organizations crank out really nice work. 
			However, it doesn’t push students to create new and exciting work that other students want to read. Much of student media and much of the classes feel very self-serving.</p>

			<p><b>Explore new platforms</b></p>
			<p>Classes are set in stone: “News 132 Audio” pretty much has to teach people how to record and edit audio.
			Student media, however, is really flexible. With the implementation of Cardinal Metrics and the offering of media analytics courses, we have the ability to measure what people are reading and where they are reading it. This means that we can test new platforms and see how they do.</p>
			<p>The problem with the existing student media/curriculum model is that we teach skills in classes on how to become a writer, photographer, videographer, “web journalist” etc.
			There’s not enough emphasis on how to use these skills to tell stories on other platforms.</p>
			<p>For example, the 5 W’s and H are super important when creating an Instagram story. It’s really important for classes to cover storytelling methods that can be applied across media. This could be a key to inspiring students to participate more.</p>

			<p><b>We need to push people to do this stuff</b></p>
			<p>NEWS 197 is a joke. </p>
			<p>People are inherently lazy, uninterested and noncommittal. Forcing them to “experience” student media or “shadow” a student media worker isn’t going to be the thing that pushes them to actually have published work. </p>
			<p>What’s going to change the mindset is introducing student media work into the classroom in a more positive light. In my time here, I’ve heard professors openly critique Daily News articles line by line. </p>
			<p>What would be more effective is asking in classes why people don’t participate in student media and informing them that student media is the best reflection of what the industry is actually like. Granted, student media must also then be the most accurate and innovative reflection of the industry. </p>
			<p>Other departments don’t have the luxury of having, for example, a working accounting firm one floor below their accounting classes. Portfolio reviews and checkups should come before the exit survey. </p>
			<p>If the reason people don’t participate in student media is they don’t like the work, “it’s boring,” or “it doesn’t interest them,” they might consider a change of major.</p>

			<p>This information was summarized during my presentation at the end of the NEWS 397 class.</p>
