                    <p class="about-copy">The first is Ball. As the namesake of the local university and the name of the family who brought jobs to Muncie in the early 20th century, the Balls have given Delaware County’s biggest city a comfortable spot on any United States map.</p>
                    <p class="about-copy">The second name has a different long-lasting effect in a state that embraces a rich basketball history. They created a new tradition on the same hardwood floor courts that were meant for a ball and a hoop.</p>
                    <p class="about-copy">Don Shondell never intended to transform the game of volleyball; in fact, he never meant to have any involvement in athletics until one incident changed it all. A factory accident while working in Fort Wayne, Indiana, paved the way for Don and his three sons, Steve, Dave and John, as pioneers of volleyball not just in Muncie, but in the United States. The accomplishments of Don and his three sons have cemented their family name in the legend and lore of Muncie and American volleyball.</p>

                      <p class="about-copy">After graduating from high school in Fort Wayne, Don Shondell looked for work wherever he could find it. While making pies in the local bakery for 70 cents an hour, he heard of a more appealing job with General Electric, paying $1.22 an hour cutting granite.</p>
                      <p class="about-copy">He said he believed General Electric would be where he would spend his life working. The factory had a history of helping individuals climb the corporate ladder year after year, and Shondell planned to be a part of that cycle. However, after an accident inside the walls of the factory, Shondell’s perspective changed forever.</p>
                      <p class="about-copy"> “One of my friends got transferred up, and about a week later, he got three of his fingers cut off,” Don Shondell said. “He was doing manual work around dangerous machines while we were just putting stuff into boxes and putting them onto conveyor belts. As soon as I saw my friend get his fingers cut off, I said, ‘That’s it. I’m out of here.’</p>
                      <p>“I had a friend I played sports with at church [who went to] Ball State who was trying to get me to come down. After that accident, I decided to go to school at Ball State.”</p>

He had experience in basketball and softball but never volleyball; yet, he decided to try.</p>

                          <p class="about-copy">Three years later, with a little help from some players at the local YMCA, Shondell was a strong setter for the club. Even off the court, Shondell maintained an athletic mindset in becoming a founding member of the fraternity Theta Chi as the athletic director. His years as a student at Ball State gave him the experience, but there was more he wanted to do in growing the game.</p>
                          <div class="subunderhead" style="text-align:left"><h1 class="subheadings">SETTING A FOUNDATION</h1></div>
                          <p class="about-copy">After graduating from Ball State in 1952, Shondell joined the military, assigned to Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri. While dedicating years of his life to the red, white and blue, Shondell got his chance to coach and build volleyball at his army base in the Ozarks.</p>
                          <p class="about-copy">“We had a residential volleyball tournament, and no one knew how to play volleyball,” Shondell said. “The first two weeks, we spent setting the ball, bumping the ball, handling the ball and so forth. We made it to the finals of the tournament where we faced off against officers who had played for years, and we lost.”</p>
                          <p class="about-copy">After that first tournament, Shondell continued to coach and play with his team, and he eventually picked up on how to find the best players. Former basketball players from the likes of Kansas and DePaul helped guide Shondell’s team to an undefeated finish and a championship in the residential tournament.</p>
                          <p class="about-copy">Returning to Indiana after his time in the service, Shondell moved to Brook, Indiana, with his wife, teaching fifth grade and coaching basketball. It was at that time he was approached by former Ball State Athletic Director Bob McCall about applying to the job as intramural director. After arriving in Muncie for a job interview, then Ball State President John Emens didn’t beat around the bush. </p>
                          <p>“I started explaining my background and how I felt pretty qualified,” Shondell said. “[Emens] said, ‘Don't waste your time. Bob wants you to have the job. Do you want the job?’ I said, ‘It would be a real treasure to work at Ball State. That's my dream job.’ He said, ‘OK, you got it.’”</p>

                          <p class="about-copy">From the start, Shondell worked to get a college league organized. After talking with coaches at nearby Wittenberg University in Ohio and Michigan State, the three universities created an eight-team league that played its first tournament in East Lansing, Michigan. The name of the league became the Midwest Intercollegiate Volleyball Association, otherwise known as MIVA.</p>
                          <p class="about-copy">After creating a volleyball presence at Ball State, Shondell’s next step was to spread awareness of the game outside Muncie. Shondell and his team traveled to a fair in Indianapolis where they hosted a clinic to show off the game. These clinics took the team everywhere from Detroit to Pittsburgh. Slowly, Shondell said, he saw more people become interested and involved in the game.</p>
                          <p class="about-copy">Shondell said his final goal, to create an NCAA Men’s Volleyball Tournament, was more paperwork than anything else. Eventually, in 1970, UCLA hosted the first NCAA Men’s Volleyball Tournament. While Shondell’s efforts proved successful, his team was still young, and the West Coast school was a powerhouse, and it still is.</p>
                          <p class="about-copy">“UCLA was just a more successful team, and we had gone and gotten our pants beat off,” Shondell said. “They had all those beach players. UCLA and Santa Barbra were just the strongest schools on the West Coast.”</p>
                          <p class="about-copy">Ball State eventually got the honors of hosting the tournament in 1972, facing the top teams in the nation in what is now the Jo Ann Gora Recreational Center. While the Cardinals lost the tournament, Shondell built something from the ground up. The seeds had been planted. The tree was growing. The only thing left was to strengthen the roots.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">To spread the word about men’s volleyball, Shondell took his players to various schools in the area to play exhibition games, where his team played a game as Shondell explained it. </p>

                            <p class="about-copy">“I saw the way the game was being mistreated, and I felt like volleyball should be a respected sport,” Shondell said. “That’s why we did these demonstrations, and we had a great time doing it. We went to places like Winchester, Indiana, for example, and showed how volleyball is an athletic sport.”</p>
                            <p class="about-copy">While Shondell and the Cardinals continued to spread the game, Shondell still struggled to get men’s volleyball registered as a varsity sport. Shondell said he mainly received pushback from former Athletic Director Robert Primmer, who served Ball State from 1958-70, and former head of Division of Physical Education and Athletics Robert McCall.</p>
                            <p>“Bob Primmer thought volleyball was a hit and giggle sport,” Don said. “He fought me in any way that he could.” </p>

                        <p class="about-copy">When the vote came in 1964, Primmer brought forward a committee he believed would not instate volleyball as a varsity sport. Shondell said up until that time a committee had never been created or used to decide if a sport should receive varsity status or not. </p>
                        <p class="about-copy">However, Shondell had close connections with those who were voting — a local volleyball player of his, one of his top students and the volleyball coaches from Burris. After Shondell spoke to the committee about volleyball as a sport, the committee, knowing his audience, decided to instate men’s volleyball a varsity sport at the university. From what Shondell remembers, Primmer didn’t take fondly to the decision.</p>

After moving from Lincoln, Nebraska, to Indianapolis fresh out of high school, Walton came to Muncie to watch a Ball State game and noticed how much fun the team had. After rejecting an offer to play college volleyball at Graceland College in Iowa, Walton knew he wanted to be a Cardinal. </p>
                        <p class="about-copy">“I just wanted to do something else, and I dreamed of playing Division I volleyball,” Walton said. “Going up to Ball State and seeing them play, I was really impressed with their team, and it looked like they were having a good time. I saw myself in that environment, and I was excited to become a part of it.” </p>

His coaching didn’t go unnoticed, as he picked up six MIVA Coach of the Year acclimations. Shondell also led Ball State to 15 NCAA Tournament Final Four appearances. The Cardinals finished in third place eight times, and the championship was hosted four times in Ball State’s Irving Gymnasium.</p>
                        <p>“It was a men's program that I grew up with, and, of course, Dad helped lead the team to 15 Final Fours,” said Steve Shondell, Don Shondell’s oldest son. “That was always special to be able to be a part of that. I've just been very, very fortunate that I learned the game at a young age, and it was really interesting.” </p>

                        <p class="about-copy">Despite the success, the program had continuous problems staying afloat financially. It wasn’t uncommon for the team not to have enough scholarships or enough travel money. The athletic department also continued to challenge Shondell about keeping men’s volleyball as a varsity sport. </p>
                        <p class="about-copy">Between the late 1970s and early 1980s, Shondell had to present to the board, again, why Ball State should keep the men’s volleyball team. Even after Shondell left the program as head coach, Ball State Athletics continued to threaten Walton with the elimination of scholarships and thousands of dollars in budget cuts to the team. In 2000, former Athletic Director Bubba Cunningham told Walton men’s volleyball was going to be one of six teams cut. However, as he did back in the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s, Shondell fought for his team to stay.</p>
                        <p class="about-copy">“I was told, ‘Your sport is going,’” Walton said. “Fortunately, Don rallied the alumni, and they wrote letter after letter. People who came from across the United States wrote letters to Ball State saying, ‘You can’t do this. This program has so much history and means so much to so many people.’ The program was saved.” </p>

                        <p class="about-copy">In 2004, the program lost $10,000 from its budget. Walton said it costs the program around $60,000 to function. Even before Ball State made the budget cuts, the team was fundraising its own money to stay above water. </p>
                        <p class="about-copy">“We did a golf outing, and we did coaching clinics to fundraise money for the program,” Walton said. “Having so many of our guys that were nationally-known coaches with reputations holding a coaches clinic became a big fundraiser for us. I think that alone raised about $10,000 a year because our alumni were willing to come back, and Don was, at that time, very helpful in organizing and helping run that coaches clinic.” </p>
                        <p class="about-copy">From the early beginnings to present day, it hasn’t been easy to keep the Ball State Men’s Volleyball program going. However, Shondell has fought for this program like it was one of his own children. Even now, at 91 years old, he can still be seen sitting behind the scoreboard at Worthen Arena. No matter how young or how old, he said, he’s supporting his team any way he can.</p>
                        <p class="about-copy">From fighting athletic directors, to keep the program alive, to having an entire training facility named after him in 2018, Shondell’s passion for Ball State Volleyball has burned endlessly. </p>
