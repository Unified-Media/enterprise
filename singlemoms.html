Kileah Adkins follows the same routine every morning as she tries to balance raising her 3-year-old son, Lucien, and all of her other responsibilities in life.</p>
 
<p class="lead">She and her son live in a small, income-based apartment on Tillotson Avenue, close to work, Ball State and his preschool.</p>

<p class="lead">“I won’t lie — there are days when it gets rough,” Adkins said. “Yes, we are struggling right now because I’m a poor, single mother, but I try to push myself by seeing the big picture. I’m miserable now, and I can stay that way the rest of my life, or I can push through for two more years and be able to give Lucien the life I want for him.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">Childhood</h3>
 
<p class="lead">Although Adkins was born in Muncie, she and her mother moved to Corbin, Kentucky, when Adkins was younger. </p>
 
<p class="lead">For the most part, Adkins said she enjoyed her childhood, so when high school graduation came, she decided to apply to Eastern Kentucky University — 10 minutes away from home.</p>
 
<p class="lead">In August 2007, Adkins began her first semester at Eastern Kentucky, but less than a year and a half later, she transferred to Ball State.</p>
 
<p class="lead">“There are a lot of reasons I left, but I really just got sick of the small town, all the drama,” Adkins said. “I wanted to be closer to the rest of my family, and I didn’t have anything holding me back.”</p>
 
<p class="lead">During her second round of college at Ball State, Adkins said her classes and home life began to overwhelm her, so she ran.

<p class="lead">“Instead of facing my problems, I dropped out of school and ran to the Florida Keys,” Adkins said. “In a few months, I met a guy and got pregnant. We were paying $1,200 a month for rent, which was fine when it was just us, but after Lucien came, we had to move and hope my family would be willing to help.”</p>

<!-- Birth -->
<div class="jumbotron paral paralsecbirth">
 
<p class="lead">Lucien Vaughn Miller was born Oct. 30, 2015, at a hospital in Florida after 23 hours of labor, one day earlier than his due date. He was 20 ¾ inches long and weighed 7 pounds 10 ounces.</p>

<p class="lead">“I was going to name him Lucious because I just really liked the sound of it, but then I heard the name Lucien, and I kind of just knew,” Adkins said. “I thought it was so beautiful.”</p>
 
<p class="lead">Adkins said the first few months after she and her boyfriend brought Lucien home were an adjustment for her.</p>
 
<p class="lead">“[His dad] stayed home with me for a week,” Adkins said. “But, when he had to go back to work, I didn’t think I would be able to get through being home with Lucien by myself. He knew how to change a diaper, and I didn’t. He had to show me a lot about what I needed to do to take care of my son.”</p>

<!-- Dad -->
<div class="jumbotron paral paralsecdad">
 
<p class="lead">Six months later, Adkins said she found out from her grandpa that Lucien’s dad had gotten into trouble and was on his way to see them for the last time, but he never made it.</p>
 
<p class="lead">Today, Adkins said Lucien’s father is in prison, but she refuses to let any of her family talk negatively about him in front of Lucien.</p>
 
<p class="lead">“My family wants me to change Lucien’s last name, but it is the only thing he will ever have of his dad. I know he isn’t the man he ended up, and I know he loves our son,” Adkins said. “When my son gets old enough to realize he doesn’t have a father, I’m going to tell him the truth. I’m going to tell him that his father loves him very much, but because of some bad decisions, he can’t be here with him.”</p>

<div class="jumbotron paral paralsecki">
 
<p class="lead">Adkins said she does not get child support from him to help with Lucien, but she and her son are the best they have ever been.</p>
 
<p class="lead">“It was really hard when he first left because I didn’t really have that other person to rely on,” Adkins said. “It was definitely the most challenging, but it has also been the most rewarding because I have learned that I am stronger than I thought I was, and I have grown as a person.”</p>

<!-- College -->
<div class="jumbotron paral paralseccollege">
 <h3 class="subhead">College, round 3</h3>
<p class="lead">Going back to college was not something Adkins ever thought she would do after dropping out of Ball State, but as a single mom of a 3-year-old, she said she knew she had to do it for him.</p>
 
<p class="lead"><span class="soundcite" data-url="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/bsd/4986a04d-abe9-4560-a99f-27cf698b6ae1.original.mp3" data-start="0" data-end="14000" data-plays="1">“It was really hard to be a student again,”</span> Adkins said. “I had a lot of doubt at first. It wasn’t just what I wanted to do; it was what I needed to do. I have gotten much better at dealing with stress than I was. I have been able to deal with my own doubt and overcome it. Now, I always tell myself, ‘I can do it.’”</p>

<p class="lead">When she first came to Ball State, Adkins said she wanted to be an editor of technical writing, but many of the people in her life talked her out of it, saying it was a dying field. So, she chose to change her major to English education because she said writing is what she’s good at.</p>

<!-- In Class -->
<div class="jumbotron paral paralsecclass">
<p class="lead">Even though she said her first semester back in classes was difficult, Adkins said she really connected with her creative writing teacher, who has been a huge support.</p>
 
<p class="lead">“Dr. Jones has been so inspiring — she knows a lot about my past and is still super understanding,” Adkins said. “I’ve talked to her about what I’ve been through. I’ve talked to her about wanting to be a teacher and about how I’m worried my past could stop me.</p>
 
<p class="lead">“She told me that kids recognize when you’re being genuine. They will see it and respect it. Kids are smart. She told me I would be able to relate to them more, and that really gave me hope to keep going. I don’t need to give up just because I’m human, and I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my life.”</p>

<!-- Ki and Lucien -->
<div class="jumbotron paral paralseckiandlucien">
<p class="lead">Darolyn Jones, assistant teaching professor of English, said Adkins has always shown a level of maturity higher than her classmates, and she always comes to class prepared.</p> 

<p class="lead">“I think Ki is really in the right field for her,” Jones said. “Since she has a child, she will be able to view teaching differently because she will be more empathetic and compassionate, especially to parents who are trying to juggle a lot.”</p>

<p class="lead">Jones also said Adkins is more prepared for the future because she is already learning how to time manage school, work and a toddler, but Jones said she wishes Ball State would advertise student options for childcare more.</p> 

<p class="lead">“Ki was not really aware of the options she had for help with her son,” Jones said. “Ball State and Muncie really do offer a vast amount of options, so it would be so helpful if there were an office or a person people could turn to for help. I think it would also be a great welcoming tactic for the university because it would draw in more single parents.”</p>

<p class="lead">Above all, Jones said Adkins is preparing herself to be an asset for whatever school she applies to because she is so committed to providing the best for her and her son.</p> 

<p class="lead">“Being in charge of a human being is the hardest job in the world; it makes school look easy,” Jones said. “Ki has so much real-life experience that any school is definitely going to want her. When she finishes college, I don’t think she’ll have an issue finding a job.”</p>

<!-- Family -->
<div class="jumbotron paral paralsecfamily">
 <h3 class="subhead">Family Support</h3>
<p class="lead">In order to get her homework done for all of her classes, Adkins said Lucien spends most Saturdays with her dad, so she can “cram everything in.”</p>

<p class="lead">“There’s no time for homework because he constantly wants my attention,” Adkins said. “I can’t even pee without him standing next to me. Just last week, I was on the phone, and he didn’t want me to be, so he looked me dead in the eyes and poured his juice on the floor.”</p>

<p class="lead">Her sister, Olivia Adkins, also helps with Lucien as much as she can, but she lives an hour away. </p>

<p class="lead">“I do my best to help Ki with anything she needs, and I would love to be able to help more,” Olivia Adkins said. “I’ve always said that my sister is my favorite person in the whole world, and I could never imagine loving anyone as much as I do her, but then Lucien came along. I experienced a love deeper than I ever thought possible.” </p>

<!-- Sister -->
<div class="jumbotron paral paralsecsister">
<p class="lead">Although Kileah Adkins still needs help from her family, she said she has gained a sense of accomplishment for herself since having Lucien and returning to college. </p>

<p class="lead">“Getting my degree is amazing, but being a mother is the most rewarding thing,” Adkins said. “I never wanted to be a mom; not because I hated kids or anything, but because I thought I would never be any good at it, and I actually am.”</p>

<p class="lead">Olivia Adkins agreed with her and said she believes becoming a mother has made Kileah more caring, especially towards children. </p>

<p class="lead">“Of course, becoming a mother will change anyone, but especially in her, it’s made huge changes,” Olivia Adkins said. “She’s still the funny brilliant person I knew, but she’s so much better now. She’s nurturing and even more caring than she ever has been.”</p>

<!-- Here and Now  -->
<div class="jumbotron paral paralsechereandnow">
 <h3 class="subhead">Here and Now</h3>
<p class="lead">Adkins is currently a senior, but she has two more years before she will graduate with her degree because she can only take four classes at a time. </p>

<p class="lead">“I think I have it all planned out,” Adkins said. “[Lucien] will be going to school by the time I am student teaching my last year, so we will be on the same hours.”</p>

<p class="lead">She said she hopes to teach a high school class after college, but she doesn’t have any set plans for the future. </p>

<p class="lead">“I’ve always liked kids but having one of my own has really deepened my understanding of them,” Adkins said. “[I think as a single mother I will be able to offer] more insight about children, how they are, how they learn, etc.”</p>

<p class="lead">Currently, Lucien attends Hazelwood Christian Preschool while she is in class or at work, since he isn’t old enough to go to kindergarten. </p>

<p class="lead">The preschool is the closest one to Ball State, and Angie Lopez, the director of Hazelwood Christian Preschool, said a discount is offered to those associated with Ball State — teachers, faculty and students. </p>

<p class="lead">“Time is important to all parents, single or multiple. They want to have as much time with their children as possible, so we try to help them get that time,” Lopez said. “Since we are so close to campus, parents can stop by in between classes, for lunch or when we have special programs. It can be hard enough for parents to leave their children and go to work, so we try to offer as much support as we can in the ways we know how.”</p>

<p class="lead">Each afternoon, Adkins said she picks Lucien up from the preschool at 4. </p> 

<p class="lead">“Kileah is a great mom, and her son is great as well,” Lopez said. “She keeps us updated on his schedule and his progress, she attends every event she can, and she just shows so much love.”</p>

<p class="mobile-lead">For the most part, Adkins said she enjoyed her childhood, so when high school graduation came, she decided to apply to Eastern Kentucky University — 10 minutes away from home.</p>
 
<p class="mobile-lead">In August 2007, Adkins began her first semester at Eastern Kentucky, but less than a year and a half later, she transferred to Ball State.</p>
 
<p class="mobile-lead">“There are a lot of reasons I left, but I really just got sick of the small town, all the drama,” Adkins said. “I wanted to be closer to the rest of my family, and I didn’t have anything holding me back.”</p>
 
<p class="mobile-lead">During her second round of college at Ball State, Adkins said her classes and home life began to overwhelm her, so she ran.

<p class="mobile-lead">“Instead of facing my problems, I dropped out of school and ran to the Florida Keys,” Adkins said. “In a few months, I met a guy and got pregnant. We were paying $1,200 a month for rent, which was fine when it was just us, but after Lucien came, we had to move and hope my family would be willing to help.”</p>

<p class="mobile-lead">Lucien Vaughn Miller was born Oct. 30, 2015, at a hospital in Florida after 23 hours of labor, one day earlier than his due date. He was 20 ¾ inches long and weighed 7 pounds 10 ounces.</p>

<p class="mobile-lead">“I was going to name him Lucious because I just really liked the sound of it, but then I heard the name Lucien, and I kind of just knew,” Adkins said. “I thought it was so beautiful.”</p>
 
<p class="mobile-lead">Adkins said the first few months after she and her boyfriend brought Lucien home were an adjustment for her.</p>
 
<p class="mobile-lead">“[His dad] stayed home with me for a week,” Adkins said. “But, when he had to go back to work, I didn’t think I would be able to get through being home with Lucien by myself. He knew how to change a diaper, and I didn’t. He had to show me a lot about what I needed to do to take care of my son.”</p>

<div class="mobile mobile-paralsecdad">
 
<p class="mobile-lead">Six months later, Adkins said she found out from her grandpa that Lucien’s dad had gotten into trouble and was on his way to see them for the last time, but he never made it.</p>
 
<p class="mobile-lead">Today, Adkins said Lucien’s father is in prison, but she refuses to let any of her family talk negatively about him in front of Lucien.</p>
 
<p class="mobile-lead">“My family wants me to change Lucien’s last name, but it is the only thing he will ever have of his dad. I know he isn’t the man he ended up, and I know he loves our son,” Adkins said. “When my son gets old enough to realize he doesn’t have a father, I’m going to tell him the truth. I’m going to tell him that his father loves him very much, but because of some bad decisions, he can’t be here with him.”</p>

<p class="mobile-lead">“It was really hard when he first left because I didn’t really have that other person to rely on,” Adkins said. “It was definitely the most challenging, but it has also been the most rewarding because I have learned that I am stronger than I thought I was, and I have grown as a person.”</p>

 <h3 class="mobile-subhead">College, round 3</h3>
<p class="mobile-lead">Going back to college was not something Adkins ever thought she would do after dropping out of Ball State, but as a single mom of a 3-year-old, she said she knew she had to do it for him.</p>
 
<p class="mobile-lead"><span class="soundcite" data-url="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/bsd/4986a04d-abe9-4560-a99f-27cf698b6ae1.original.mp3" data-start="0" data-end="14000" data-plays="1">“It was really hard to be a student again,”</span> Adkins said. “I had a lot of doubt at first. It wasn’t just what I wanted to do; it was what I needed to do. I have gotten much better at dealing with stress than I was. I have been able to deal with my own doubt and overcome it. Now, I always tell myself, ‘I can do it.’”</p>

<p class="mobile-lead">When she first came to Ball State, Adkins said she wanted to be an editor of technical writing, but many of the people in her life talked her out of it, saying it was a dying field. So, she chose to change her major to English education because she said writing is what she’s good at.</p>

<p class="mobile-lead">Even though she said her first semester back in classes was difficult, Adkins said she really connected with her creative writing teacher, who has been a huge support.</p>
 
<p class="mobile-lead">“Dr. Jones has been so inspiring — she knows a lot about my past and is still super understanding,” Adkins said. “I’ve talked to her about what I’ve been through. I’ve talked to her about wanting to be a teacher and about how I’m worried my past could stop me.</p>
 
<p class="mobile-lead">“She told me that kids recognize when you’re being genuine. They will see it and respect it. Kids are smart. She told me I would be able to relate to them more, and that really gave me hope to keep going. I don’t need to give up just because I’m human, and I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my life.”</p>

<!-- Ki and Lucien -->
<div class="mobile mobile-paralseckiandlucien">
<p class="mobile-lead">Darolyn Jones, assistant teaching professor of English, said Adkins has always shown a level of maturity higher than her classmates, and she always comes to class prepared.</p> 

<p class="mobile-lead">“I think Ki is really in the right field for her,” Jones said. “Since she has a child, she will be able to view teaching differently because she will be more empathetic and compassionate, especially to parents who are trying to juggle a lot.”</p>

<p class="mobile-lead">Jones also said Adkins is more prepared for the future because she is already learning how to time manage school, work and a toddler, but Jones said she wishes Ball State would advertise student options for childcare more.</p> 

<p class="mobile-lead">“Ki was not really aware of the options she had for help with her son,” Jones said. “Ball State and Muncie really do offer a vast amount of options, so it would be so helpful if there were an office or a person people could turn to for help. I think it would also be a great welcoming tactic for the university because it would draw in more single parents.”</p>

<p class="mobile-lead">Above all, Jones said Adkins is preparing herself to be an asset for whatever school she applies to because she is so committed to providing the best for her and her son.</p> 

<p class="mobile-lead">“Being in charge of a human being is the hardest job in the world; it makes school look easy,” Jones said. “Ki has so much real-life experience that any school is definitely going to want her. When she finishes college, I don’t think she’ll have an issue finding a job.”</p>

<p class="mobile-lead">In order to get her homework done for all of her classes, Adkins said Lucien spends most Saturdays with her dad, so she can “cram everything in.”</p>

<p class="mobile-lead">“There’s no time for homework because he constantly wants my attention,” Adkins said. “I can’t even pee without him standing next to me. Just last week, I was on the phone, and he didn’t want me to be, so he looked me dead in the eyes and poured his juice on the floor.”</p>

<p class="mobile-lead">Her sister, Olivia Adkins, also helps with Lucien as much as she can, but she lives an hour away. </p>

<p class="mobile-lead">“I do my best to help Ki with anything she needs, and I would love to be able to help more,” Olivia Adkins said. “I’ve always said that my sister is my favorite person in the whole world, and I could never imagine loving anyone as much as I do her, but then Lucien came along. I experienced a love deeper than I ever thought possible.” </p>

<p class="mobile-lead">Although Kileah Adkins still needs help from her family, she said she has gained a sense of accomplishment for herself since having Lucien and returning to college. </p>

<p class="mobile-lead">“Getting my degree is amazing, but being a mother is the most rewarding thing,” Adkins said. “I never wanted to be a mom; not because I hated kids or anything, but because I thought I would never be any good at it, and I actually am.”</p>

<p class="mobile-lead">Olivia Adkins agreed with her and said she believes becoming a mother has made Kileah more caring, especially towards children. </p>

<p class="mobile-lead">“Of course, becoming a mother will change anyone, but especially in her, it’s made huge changes,” Olivia Adkins said. “She’s still the funny brilliant person I knew, but she’s so much better now. She’s nurturing and even more caring than she ever has been.”</p>

<p class="mobile-lead">Adkins is currently a senior, but she has two more years before she will graduate with her degree because she can only take four classes at a time. </p>

<p class="mobile-lead">“I think I have it all planned out,” Adkins said. “[Lucien] will be going to school by the time I am student teaching my last year, so we will be on the same hours.”</p>

<p class="mobile-lead">She said she hopes to teach a high school class after college, but she doesn’t have any set plans for the future. </p>

<p class="mobile-lead">“I’ve always liked kids but having one of my own has really deepened my understanding of them,” Adkins said. “[I think as a single mother I will be able to offer] more insight about children, how they are, how they learn, etc.”</p>

<p class="mobile-lead">Currently, Lucien attends Hazelwood Christian Preschool while she is in class or at work, since he isn’t old enough to go to kindergarten. </p>

<p class="mobile-lead">The preschool is the closest one to Ball State, and Angie Lopez, the director of Hazelwood Christian Preschool, said a discount is offered to those associated with Ball State — teachers, faculty and students. </p>

<p class="mobile-lead">“Time is important to all parents, single or multiple. They want to have as much time with their children as possible, so we try to help them get that time,” Lopez said. “Since we are so close to campus, parents can stop by in between classes, for lunch or when we have special programs. It can be hard enough for parents to leave their children and go to work, so we try to offer as much support as we can in the ways we know how.”</p>

<p class="mobile-lead">Each afternoon, Adkins said she picks Lucien up from the preschool at 4. </p> 

<p class="mobile-lead">“Kileah is a great mom, and her son is great as well,” Lopez said. “She keeps us updated on his schedule and his progress, she attends every event she can, and she just shows so much love.”</p>
