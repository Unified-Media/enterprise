                        <p class="about-copy">As a new decade approaches, Ball State President Geoffrey Mearns said there has been "excellent progress" at the university these past 10 years and feels the university is on track for a "brighter future" in the next.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">Since Mearns took over as Ball State’s president in May 2017, he said some of the university’s successes he’s proud of include growth in student enrollment, on-time graduation rates, expansion of on-campus facilities, alumni engagement and philanthropic support.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">“I would be reluctant to take credit for any of the successes because I think the progress we make as an institution requires the collective commitment and engagement of all of our faculty, staff, our students and alumni,” he said.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">“I would be reluctant to take credit for any of the successes because I think the progress we make as an institution requires the collective commitment and engagement of all of our faculty, staff, our students and alumni,” he said.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">One thing Mearns said he was more directly involved in is helping retain and recruit individuals to serve in leadership roles at the university.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">“I'm really pleased and proud with the quality of people who have decided to join our leadership team — whether it's people who are serving as vice presidents, or the deans that we've been able to attract during this time,” Mearns said.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">Going into the next decade, Mearns said the most visible change Ball State students will see is the physical transformation of the campus — with an academic building, two residence halls, a dining hall, the Multicultural Center and a green lawn following the tearing down of the Emens parking garage.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">“I think anyone who comes to campus will continue to see the evolution and transformation of the physical space,” he said.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">Prior to his arrival to the university, Mearns said Ball State played a national leadership role in providing experiential learning opportunities to students in their third and fourth years of education.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">As part of its Strategic Plan, he said the university’s goal is to bring those opportunities to first and second year students, provide them exposure to immersive learning courses and provide opportunities for them to participate in co-curricular activities.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">“We want to do that earlier in the educational experience,” Mearns said. “It will be helpful for the students to have the challenge associated with those learning experiences early on, as opposed to simply being passive recipients of knowledge and content.”</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">Apart from Ball State’s partnership with the Muncie Community Schools, he said the university’s work in the community “continue to create a more vibrant Muncie which we know that our students want.”</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">Students, Mearns said, want the ability to visit restaurants, parks and other entertainment in the Muncie community, beyond the opportunities offered on campus.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">“I believe over the next five to 10 years, you're going to see the continued transformation and revitalization of Muncie,” he said.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">One area Mearns said the university wants to continue focusing its time and attention on, is supporting students who seek the services of Ball State’s Counseling Center.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">“That is an issue that is challenging colleges and universities all across the country, but we certainly want to be attentive and responsive to the students who are seeking that important support,” he said.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">Reversing the decline in first-to-second-year retention rates and improving the student experience for those who aren’t on-campus undergraduate students, Mearns said, were some other areas the university could improve on.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">After Ball State students become alumni, Mearns said he hopes they will continue being engaged with the university.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">“As we continue towards this path towards an even brighter future, we want our students after they graduate, to stay engaged with the institution, continue to be a part of the growth of the institution and continue to be a part of the impact that our institution can have on our community, on our region, on our state and on our country,” he said.</p>

                            <p class="about-copy">Four presidents have presided over Ball State in the 2010s. Jo Ann Gora served for the longest period, and Terry King for the shortest.</p>

                            <p class="about-copy pt-3"><b>Jo Ann Gora | 2004-2014:</b><br>After serving as the vice president for academic affairs and provost at Old Dominion University and chancellor at the University of Massachusetts Boston, Jo Ann Gora joined Ball State as its 14th president and its first female president. During her 10 years with the university, more than $520 million of construction and renovations were seen on campus. In 2005 she was awarded the Sagamore of the Wabash, Indiana’s highest civil honor. In 2010, the Jo Ann Gora Student Recreation and Wellness center was dedicated in her honor.</p>

                            <p class="about-copy pt-3"><b>Paul Ferguson | 2014-2016:</b><br>During the tenure of President Paul Ferguson, Ball State saw its student enrollment increase and the highest four-year graduation rates for all Indiana public universities. Approval for the Health Professions Building also occurred during his time. However, Ferguson resigned without providing an explanation after serving in the position for 18 months. He still had three and a half years before his contract expired. Ferguson later received a job at Biola University a private Christian school in California, as founding dean of its school of science, technology and health.</p>

                            <p class="about-copy pt-3"><b>Terry King | 2016-2017:</b><br>When Ferguson suddenly resigned, President Terry King postponed his retirement to take on the responsibility until the university had found a replacement. With a PhD in chemical engineering, King began his career as an engineer. He has won awards for his research, holds three patents and has received federal grants. King served as a professor at Iowa State University for 15 years and later as a dean at Kansas State University. In 2006, he began working at Ball State as provost and executive vice president for academic affairs.</p>
