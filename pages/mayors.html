McShurley previously served in the Office of the Provost and Vice President of Academic Affairs at Ball State. While she ran a lean administration with respect to the city’s budget, some of her accomplishments during her tenure included strategic planning with respect to city parks, work with Prairie Creek Reservoir and Tuhey Pool, and infrastructure improvements in terms of paving and sidewalks, said professor emeritus of political science Ray Scheele in a <a class="about-link" href="https://www.ballstatedailynews.com/article/2011/11/bsu-political-science-professors-look-back-on-mcshurley-forward-to-tyler">previous Daily News article</a>.

Tyler, the first Democratic mayor of the city in 20 years, previously served as a Muncie firefighter
                            and as a state representative in the Indiana General Assembly. In 2015, he won a second term as mayor after running unopposed.
                            Tyler’s second term coincided with the arrests of six Muncie individuals as part of a multi-year and ongoing investigation by the FBI and IRS
                            into the payment of kickbacks in exchange for public works projects and other corruption-related matters in the city. After deciding

He was indicted on one charge of theft of government
                            funds and faces a jury trial in federal court Jan. 21, 2020. As mayor, Tyler said one his best memories was bringing the Cardinal Greenway,
                            Indiana’s longest span of recreational trails, to the Muncie community.</p>

                            after winning more than 60 percent of the popular vote in the November mayoral elections. Ridenour previously served on
                            Muncie’s City Council and as an associate vice president at MutualBank. His win was a referendum on the current
                            city administration and the multiple investigations, said Chad Kinsella, assistant professor of political science,
                            public administration and American politics at Ball State. As mayor, Ridenour said he wants to institute long-term
                            infrastructure plans, look into Taxi Increment Financing (TIF) districts and improve communication
