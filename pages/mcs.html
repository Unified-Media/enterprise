                        <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-6 pl-3 pr-3">
                          
                        <p class="about-copy">A year and a half into Ball State’s partnership with Muncie Community Schools (MCS), Ball State President Geoffrey Mearns reflects on the achievements of the partnership thus far.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">Since the passage of House Bill 1315 in May 2018 by the Indiana General Assembly, Ball State assumed the responsibility of helping run MCS. In June that year, the university appointed seven individuals to serve on the MCS board who began their duties the following month.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">Mearns said he was gratified by the “quality of the individuals who were willing to step up and serve on the school board.”</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">One of the board’s achievements, he said, was “stemm[ing] the hemorrhaging in enrollment.” According to the Indiana Department of Education’s website, the 2018-19 academic year marked the first time in five years that the schools saw a higher enrollment than the previous year.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">The board balanced the schools’ budget and generated sufficient revenue in the first year of its existence to provide a one-time salary stipend to MCS teachers and staff, Mearns said. In the second year of the partnership, he said, the school corporation was able to give its teachers and staff a recurring salary increase for the first time in nearly a decade.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">“I was confident that we could rally not just the university campus, but the entire community, and that's happened,” Mearns said.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">As a result, he said the partnership initially helped stabilized the school district and is now working on reversing the trajectory for MCS.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">“If you spoke to the teachers, staff and the parents, I think what they've relatively quickly realized is that we're restoring their sense of hope and optimism about the educational opportunities that can be provided to their children,” Mearns said.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">Going into 2020, the Ball State-MCS Academic Innovation Council will present the long-term Academic Innovation and Financial Viability Plan to the Indiana General Assembly in June. The council hosted an inaugural district-wide Innovation Summit in September 2019 to help contribute to the plan.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">Some of the work listed in the plan has already begun, Mearns said, like having professional development liaisons in all of the schools. Once the plan is approved by state legislators, he said, Ball State and MCS will be fully focused on implementing the strategies in the plan.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">Sometimes, tensions between city residents and the university community, he said, exists in college towns like Muncie. Mearns said progress the university was making progress to release this tension well before his arrival at Ball State in 2017, adding the partnership was one example of how the city and the university can work collectively.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">The Community Engagement Council was formed as part of the partnership to advocate for MCS through fundraising, advocacy and volunteerism.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">According to Ball State’s website, community institutions committed $3.1 million for the local schools soon after the passage of H.B. 1315. It also states the university is directing $50,000 to fund classroom supplies for MCS educators to use in their classrooms.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">The council, along with MCS, also organized two teacher-appreciation events in January and May 2019 to demonstrate the value the partnership placed on Muncie educators.</p>

                        <p class="about-copy">“It was a perfect example of the community and the teachers and the staff being supported by the university and by other businesses in the community,” Mearns said.</p>

Gov. Eric Holcomb signed a bill allowing a state board to monitor MCS’s debt reduction actions and to take control of the district if enough progress toward finding a financial footing is not made</p>

The bill passed the House and the Senate, but one amendment to the bill fails causing it to be returned to the House. Legislators failed to address the bill during the March legislative session before the session’s final hours, killing the bill. Shortly after the end of the regular session, Holcomb called for a special session.</p>
